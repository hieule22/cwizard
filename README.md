# Contest Wizard

Contest Wizard is a command-line tool written in C++ that allows competitive
programs to manage and test their solutions.
It is developed on top of [Bazel](http://bazel.io), Google's very own build
tool, with the help of
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and the
[Boost](http://www.boost.org) library.
